## Make Change Project

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

Program to calculate change.

Technologies used:

* Advanced Java Expressions
* While Loops
* if Statements
* Methods
* Casting Data Types


#### Project Description

The objective of this project is to create a cash register that will calculate the exact amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and amount tendered.
The exact currency returned to the customer will be provided i.e. how many ten dollar bills, five dollar bills, quarters, dimes, etc.

#### How To Run This Project

To run this project, enter the price of the item you'd like to purchase. Next, enter how much money you will be tendering to pay for the item. If funds are insufficient, you will be prompted again to enter the price of the item and the amount of money tendered to pay for the item.

#### Lessons Learned

Casting from a double to an integer was a valuable asset in my program. It helped me to avoid issues with rounding numbers or having too many numbers after the decimal being returned.

Creating the mathematical formula to determine how many $20 bills, $5 bills, etc. was difficult at first. It was important to process the program requirements one step at a time.
